            AgriLeafNet is an AI-based smart farming system designed to help farmers
            detect plant diseases quickly and easily.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Instead of depending on guesswork or waiting for experts, farmers can
            simply upload an image of a leaf and instantly know the condition of
            their crop.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The system not only detects the disease but also provides useful
            suggestions such as fertilizers and sprays, helping farmers take the
            right action at the right time.

            🌾 Why This Project is Important
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Farmers often face difficulty in identifying plant diseases at an early
            stage. This delay can lead to serious crop damage and financial loss.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            AgriLeafNet helps solve this problem by providing quick and reliable
            results, allowing farmers to take preventive actions before the disease spreads.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            This leads to better crop health, increased yield, and improved farming outcomes.
